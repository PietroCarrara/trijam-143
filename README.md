# Candlelight ðŸŽƒ
Keep the lights on! (*[play online!](https://arnett.itch.io/candlelight)*)

*Game made in 05:15h as a submission to the [143rd Trijam game jam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-143)*

One night each year, the pumpkins roam the earth looking for fun, but if they go to sleep, they'll wake up next morning as just a regular pumpkin.
Try to have fun for as long as you can hold! Having the lights off makes it harder to stay up.

**Roll using the left/right arrows, jump pressing up. Hold space near a candle to light it  up.**
